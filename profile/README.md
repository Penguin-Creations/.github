# Organization Guidelines

Welcome to our organization’s repository! Here, you’ll find the files and projects that form the core of our collaborative work.

## Branch and Forking Guidelines

### Branch Creation
- **Each project must have its own main branch**, named in the format: `Project-Main`.
- This branch serves as the official and stable source for all project-related work.

### Forking for Development
- Developers should create a personal fork of the project’s main branch (`Project-Main`). Name your fork using the format: `Project-Username`.
- You are free to work and make changes **on your personal fork** without restrictions.

### Merging Changes
- Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request to the `Project-Main` branch.
- At least **one team member** must review and approve your changes to ensure they are bug-free before merging.

## Important Notes
- Creating a fork from `Project-Main` to `Project-Username` is **mandatory for all development tasks**.
- For non-development tasks (e.g., documentation, management), creating a fork may not be necessary.

By following these guidelines, we ensure a smooth collaborative process while maintaining the quality and integrity of our projects. Thank you for contributing to our organization!
